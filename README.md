# data_analysis_stats-python
This is mini project on data analysis using python. This includes .csv files with which the data are being extracted and analyzed and represented in graphical form. Specific libraries have been used for the accurate analysis of the data. I (personally) enjoyed it while analysing it and I would likely to do this kind of projects more in my upcoming days which includes machine learning algorithms. 

The data which I have used for the anlysis is the authentic data i.e, data obtained through conducting surveys in the form Questionnaires. And I have taken the help of google forms for designing the questions (that made me comfortable).
